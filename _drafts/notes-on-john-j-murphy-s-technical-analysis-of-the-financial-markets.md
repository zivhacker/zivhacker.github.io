[John J. Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murphy_(technical_analyst))'s *Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets* was first published in 1997. Here are some notes I took from the [expanded version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735200661), which was published in 1999.

## Chapter 1. Philosophy of Technical Analysis

> *Technical analysis is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of forecasting future price trends.* The term "market action" includes the three principal sources of information available to the technicianâ€”price, volume, and open interest. (Open interest is used only in futures and options.)

### Philosophy or Rationale

#### Market Action Discounts Everything

The history of price doesn't decide the future price, the market does it, but the price reflects the supply and demand of the market.

#### Prices Move in Trends

The price moves in a trend until the trend is reversed.

#### History Repeats Itself

The market action is a reflection of human psychology, which tends not to change. This feature makes price patterns repeats.

### Technical versus Fundamental Forecasting

> The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the technician studies the effect.

### Analysis versus Timing
