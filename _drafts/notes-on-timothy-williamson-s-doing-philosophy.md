Here are some notes I took from [Timothy Williamson](https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/people/timothy-williamson)'s [*Doing Philosophy: From Common Curiosity to Logical Reasoning*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0198822510), which was published in 2018.

## 1. Introduction

Philosophy is the source of all sciences. Since the independence of science from philosophy, it has been found that science does a better job than philosophy in answering some of the questions that philosophy is concerned with. Then, the task of philosophy should be to find some problems that science cannot solve and to try to solve them by philosophical methods.

## 2. Starting from Common Sense

### Common Sense in Philosophy

We have to start from *common sense*, and hope to go far beyond it.

### What Is Common Sense?

Common sense in a society is knowledge, belief, or whatever most of its members know. Thus, common sense varies from one society to another.

### Common-Sense Questions, Philosophical Questions

The most basic common-sense questions are "what is" questions about anything, e.g. "What is justice?" and "What is knowledge?" Common sense can give us a definition or a concept of these terms, but if we go deeper, if we want to explain the underlying difference between just and unjust, between knowledge and ignorance, we are concerning philosophical questions.

### Common Sense as a Check on Philosophy

> Any theory inconsistent with common-sense knowledge is false.

Since common sense could be wrong, I would like to say that checked common sense can be a check on philosophical theory.

### Fallibility about Evidence

Many philosophers treat *appearances* as evidence. In their opinion, we may be wrong about how things really are, but at least we are not wrong about how things appear to us. But in fact, we humans are fallible in making judgments even about how things appear to us.

## 3. Disputing
