[*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) by [Harold Abelson](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/hal.html) and [Gerald Jay Sussman](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/gjs.html) with Julie Sussman was first published in 1985. Here are some notes I took from the [second edition](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf), which was published in 1996.

## Preface to the First Edition

> Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems.
