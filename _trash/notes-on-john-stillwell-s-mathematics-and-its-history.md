*Mathematics and Its History* written by [John Stillwell](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/john-stillwell) was first published in 1989. Here are some notes I took from the [3rd edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/144196052X), which was published in 2010.

## Preface to the First Edition

> This book aims to give a unified view of undergraduate mathematics by approaching the subject through its history.

So this book is not on the history of mathematics.

## 1. The Theorem of Pythagoras

> The Pythagorean theorem is the most appropriate starting point for a book on mathematics and its history. It is not only the oldest mathematical theorem, but also the source of three great streams of mathematical thought: numbers, geometry, and infinity.

### 1.1 Arithmetic and Geometry

Arithmetic is based on counting *discrete* objects, while geometry is concerning *continuous* objects. The Pythagorean theorem is the first hint of a hidden, deeper relationship between arithmetic and geometry.

### 1.2 Pythagorean Triples
